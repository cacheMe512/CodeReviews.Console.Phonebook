# Phone Book Application

## Introduction
This is a simple console-based Phone Book application implemented in C# using Entity Framework as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). The application allows users to manage their contacts by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through the console. The database schema is generated using the Code-First approach in Entity Framework, and SQL Server is used as the database provider.

## Features
- Add, update, delete, and view contacts
- Categorize contacts into different groups (e.g., Family, Friends, Work, etc.)
- Validate email and phone number formats
- Display contact details in a user-friendly console interface
- Use Entity Framework to interact with the database

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- Spectre.Console (for enhanced console UI)
